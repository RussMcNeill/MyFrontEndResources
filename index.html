        <h2>Bellevue/East Side Traffic</h2>
        <p>I-405 is the major north-south arterial for Bellevue and the surrounding east side (of Lake Washington) communities.</p>
        <p>Highway 520 is a an east-west highway that crosses Lake Washington to Seattle and extends to the east into Redmond</p>
        <p>I-90 crosses Lake Washington south of 520, and extends east to Issaquah (and beyond, all the way across the country).</p>
        <p>All of the above highways have high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes.  In addition, I-405 north of Bellevue and 520 across Lake Washington have Express Toll lanes.  These are HOV lanes that allow single occupancy vehicles to buy access with a <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/GoodToGo/default.htm">"Good to Go" pass</a>.</p>
        <p>Traffic is worst during morning and afternoon rush hour.</p>
